## About

This marks a significant milestone in my journey as a programmer. Kruz Weather is one of my early projects, and I aspire to enhance its capabilities as I advance through my college studies. Your constructive feedback is invaluable, so please don't hesitate to connect with me on Discord: Kruz420. Additionally, feel free to submit pull requests to contribute to the project.

## Getting Started

1. Open the `template.env` file and replace the placeholder `API_KEY` with your own API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).
2. Rename the file from "template.env" to just ".env" when saving.

Happy coding!

## Installation (Executable)

1. After completing the steps above, drag and drop the folder to your preferred location (e.g., Documents) and extract it from the zip file.
2. Navigate inside the folder, right-click on `KruzWeather.exe`, and choose "Send to" -> "Desktop (create shortcut)."
3. Launch the application conveniently from your desktop.
