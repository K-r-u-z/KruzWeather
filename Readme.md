Kruz Weather v.1.0.0 (Work-in-Progress)
Written by Kruz

Welcome to Kruz Weather's first release 1.0.0! This is one of my first "big" project
as a beginner programmer. I wish to expand this app to have more functionality 
as my knowledge progresses through college. If you have any helpful feedback
please feel free to reach out to me on Discord: Kruz420, or feel free to submit a pull request. 


To get started:

	Make sure to open the "template.env" and replace the API_KEY with your own
	from https://openweathermap.org/api 
	
	Also make sure to rename the file to from "templete.env" to just ".env" when you save.
	Happy coding!


Installation: (To run executeable)

	After doing the steps above
	Drag and drop this folder to your Documents (or any other place you like) and extract it from the zip.
	Navigate inside the folder in your Documents, right-click on KruzWeather.exe, and select 
	"Send to" ---> Desktop (create shortcut).
	Now you can launch the application conveniently from your desktop.



Patch Notes: 1.0.0:

> Version 1.0.0 Released.

> Periodic updates will be rolled out. (Hopefully with you guys support!)
